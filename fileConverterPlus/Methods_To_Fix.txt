List of working methods that could be rewritten to simplify, clarify etc:

FileDropper.java:

listAllPaths: Recursive function, currently returns all file paths of dropped files, even in subfolders
Problem: Takes in List() (Raw type), converts each file in List to File(),
if file is a folder (Directory) all files in it are made into a list and the method is recursively called again.
Too many conversion steps

RoundedBorder.java:

paintBorder: Color from JFrame is not inherited, defined the color again before changing paint color
